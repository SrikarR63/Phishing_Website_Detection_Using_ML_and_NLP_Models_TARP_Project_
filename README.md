# Phishing_Website_Detection_Using_ML_and_NLP_Models_TARP_

With the increasing use of technology, cybercrimes have become a major threat to internet users. Social engineering is content that tricks visitors into doing something dangerous, such as revealing confidential information or downloading software. One of the most common types of social engineering and cyber-attacks is phishing, where attackers create websites that appear legitimate but are designed to steal sensitive information from users. Therefore, detecting phishing websites has become a crucial task in ensuring online security. There are different features to identify a phishing website such as URL-based features, domain-based features, Page-based features and Content-based features etc. Such features can be leveraged by machine learning algorithms to detect if a website is a phishing website or not.

In our paper, we introduce an advanced approach to phishing website detection, harnessing the power of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing alongside the cutting-edge GPT-2 model. The approach begins with data preprocessing, extracting key features from a dataset comprising both good and bad URLs. The model is meticulously trained, and its performance rigorously assessed.
